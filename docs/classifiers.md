## Most Used Classifiers and Top Performance

| Classifier                      | Number of Studies | Mean Accuracy (%) |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**| 27                | ~86–87            |
| **Random Forest (RF)**          | 20                | ~86–87            |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**   | 16                | 76                |
| **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** | —                 | **89.5**          |

*Note: MLP achieved the highest average accuracy across reviewed studies.*

## Segmentation Windows

- **Overlapping windows**: Variable-length segments used in multiple studies to enable continuous monitoring (e.g., sliding windows with partial overlap).  
- **Uniform-length windows**: Fixed-duration segments used for standardized comparisons between conditions.
