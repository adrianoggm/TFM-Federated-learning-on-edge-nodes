## Reviewed Literature

### References
1.- Article that makes a literature overview about the different sensors, architectures, and security concerns on IoTHealth systems. 

2.- Summary

This article reviews the use of wearable devices to detect and monitor stress, highlighting five key stages: physiological data collection (in controlled and real-world settings), preprocessing (signal filtering and normalization), feature extraction (HRV statistics, tonic/phasic EDA features, among others), machine learning model training (traditional classifiers and deep learning), and performance evaluation. It also addresses challenges such as personalization, real-time detection, and the integration of privacy and usability in real-world applications.

  abstract = {This systematic review compiles research from the last decade on the use of wearables to detect stress. It summarizes sensor types (e.g., heart rate and heart rate variability via ECG/PPG, skin conductance via EDA, skin temperature, accelerometry, etc.) and describes common methodological stages: continuous physiological data collection, preprocessing (e.g., signal filtering), feature extraction (e.g., HRV statistics, tonic/phasic EDA features), and machine learning model training. The review covers both laboratory and real-world studies, discussing algorithms used, performance, and future opportunities (e.g., improving personalization and early intervention upon stress detection).}
