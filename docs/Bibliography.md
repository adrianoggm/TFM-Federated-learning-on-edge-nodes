## Reviewed Literature

### References
1.- Article that makes a literature overview about the different sensors, architectures, and security concerns on IoTHealth systems. 

2.- This article reviews the use of wearable devices to detect and monitor stress, highlighting five key stages: physiological data collection (in controlled and real-world settings), preprocessing (signal filtering and normalization), feature extraction (HRV statistics, tonic/phasic EDA features, among others), machine learning model training (traditional classifiers and deep learning), and performance evaluation. It also addresses challenges such as personalization, real-time detection, and the integration of privacy and usability in real-world applications.

3.- This systematic literature review synthesizes state-of-the-art methods for mental-stress recognition using data-fusion of wearable sensor signals and machine learning. It defines seven research questions covering fusion strategies, classifier choices, sensor modalities, temporal segmentation, evaluation metrics and classifier performance. After screening 163 Scopus results (49 included studies), the review reports prevailing practices—feature-level fusion, widely used classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, KNN), ECG/EEG sensors, overlapping and uniform time windows—and summarizes typical model accuracies and future research directions.

  abstract = {This systematic review compiles research from the last decade on the use of wearables to detect stress. It summarizes sensor types (e.g., heart rate and heart rate variability via ECG/PPG, skin conductance via EDA, skin temperature, accelerometry, etc.) and describes common methodological stages: continuous physiological data collection, preprocessing (e.g., signal filtering), feature extraction (e.g., HRV statistics, tonic/phasic EDA features), and machine learning model training. The review covers both laboratory and real-world studies, discussing algorithms used, performance, and future opportunities (e.g., improving personalization and early intervention upon stress detection).}
